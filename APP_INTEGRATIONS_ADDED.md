# App Integrations Tool Added to AI Agent

## What Was Added

The AI agent (Imi) now has access to **500+ app integrations** including Gmail, Slack, Google Docs, Excel, Notion, and more through a new `appIntegrations` tool.

## Key Features

### Natural Interface
- The AI never mentions "Composio" or "ToolRouter" to users
- Uses natural language: "connect to Gmail", "send via Slack", "create a Google Doc"
- Handles authentication automatically and guides users through setup when needed

### Four Core Actions

1. **Search** - Discover available actions
   - Example: "send an email via Gmail"
   - Returns available tools and their required arguments

2. **Execute** - Run actions on connected apps
   - Example: Send an actual email, create a document, post to Slack
   - Handles authentication errors gracefully

3. **Check Connections** - See which apps are connected
   - Shows all connected integrations
   - Displays session status

4. **Initiate Connection** - Get OAuth URL to connect new apps
   - Example: Get link to connect Gmail, Slack, Notion
   - AI provides link naturally without technical jargon
   - Handles the OAuth flow through Composio's backend

## Files Modified

### 1. `/convex/tools/appIntegrations.ts` (NEW)
- Wraps ToolRouter functionality in a user-friendly interface
- Handles authentication and error cases
- Auto-detects userId from context
- Returns clear success/error messages

### 2. `/convex/agents/imiAgent.ts` (UPDATED)
- Added `appIntegrations` to available tools
- Updated instructions to mention app integration capabilities
- Provided usage examples for the AI
- Keeps existing `searchTwitter` tool working alongside

## How It Works

1. **User makes a request**: "Can you send me an email with that summary?"

2. **AI searches for tools**:
   ```typescript
   appIntegrations({
     action: "search",
     taskDescription: "send email"
   })
   ```

3. **AI executes the action**:
   ```typescript
   appIntegrations({
     action: "execute",
     toolSlug: "GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL",
     toolArguments: {
       to: "user@example.com",
       subject: "Summary",
       body: "Here's your summary..."
     }
   })
   ```

4. **If auth needed**: AI explains naturally and guides user through connection

## User Experience

### Before:
```
User: "Email me that summary"
AI: "I can't send emails directly"
```

### After (Connected):
```
User: "Email me that summary"
AI: "Sure! Let me send that via Gmail... [executes]
     âœ“ Email sent to your inbox!"
```

### After (Not Connected):
```
User: "I want to connect Gmail"
AI: [calls appIntegrations with action "initiate_connection" and appName "gmail"]
AI: "Here's the link to connect Gmail: https://composio.dev/oauth/...
     Just click that and sign in to connect your account!"
```

## Behind the Scenes

- Uses existing ToolRouter infrastructure
- Leverages `toolRouterSessions` table for user-specific connections
- Maintains session state and handles expiration
- Auto-connects to ToolRouter client per request
- Supports parallel tool execution through Composio's backend

## What the AI Now Knows

From the AI's perspective (in its instructions):

```
You have access to powerful tools:
- searchTwitter: Find tweets, trends, and user information
- appIntegrations: Connect to apps like Gmail, Slack, Google Docs, 
  Notion, and 500+ other services
  - Search for actions you can do
  - Execute actions on connected apps
  - If an app isn't connected yet, guide users through setup
- memory: Remember past conversations with the user
```

## Next Steps

To make this fully functional, you'll need to:

1. Ensure ToolRouter sessions are created for users (already implemented via `/api/tool-router/create-session`)
2. Test the OAuth callback flow for connecting apps (already implemented via `/api/composio/callback`)
3. Consider adding UI elements to show connected apps
4. Add more specific examples in agent instructions for common workflows

## Technical Notes

- Tool automatically tries to detect `userId` from agent context
- Falls back to requiring explicit `userId` if auto-detection fails
- Uses `ctx.runQuery` to access database from action context
- Dynamically imports `ToolRouterClient` to avoid circular dependencies
- Handles all ToolRouter meta-tools: `COMPOSIO_SEARCH_TOOLS`, `COMPOSIO_MULTI_EXECUTE_TOOL`, `COMPOSIO_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS`

## Security

- User-specific sessions ensure data isolation
- Each user's connections are private to their account
- OAuth tokens managed by Composio backend
- Session expiration handled automatically
