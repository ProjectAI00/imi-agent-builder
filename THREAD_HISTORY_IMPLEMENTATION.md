# Thread History Implementation - Conversation Continuity Fix

## Problem Solved
The AI agent had complete amnesia between messages - it couldn't remember what it said in previous messages within the same conversation. Layer 1 context searches were returning 0 results, and the agent treated every message as if it was the first in a new conversation.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Thread History Fetching
Added automatic fetching of the last 20 messages from the current thread in `convex/agents/streamingAgentLoop.ts`:

```typescript
// Fetch recent thread history for conversation continuity
const threadHistoryResult = await ctx.runQuery(api.chat.messages.list, {
  threadId,
  paginationOpts: {
    numItems: 20,
    cursor: null,
  },
});

const threadHistory = threadHistoryResult?.page || [];
```

### 2. Conversation History Building
Built a proper conversation history array from thread messages:

- Filters out system messages (starting with `[SYSTEM:`)
- Converts messages to LLM-compatible format (role + content)
- Injects Layer 1 context into system prompt as `<relevant_memories>`
- Adds current user message to the conversation

### 3. AI SDK Integration
Changed from using `prompt` (single string) to `messages` (array) in streamText:

```typescript
const result = await streamText({
  model: openrouter(selectedModel, {
    reasoning: { exclude: true }
  } as any),
  system: systemMessage,
  messages: conversationHistory,  // ← Now includes full thread history
  tools: tools.reduce((acc, tool) => {
    // ...
  }, {}),
  maxSteps: 5,
});
```

### 4. Multi-turn Tool Calling
Updated continuation logic to properly append tool results to conversation history:

```typescript
// Append assistant's response and tool results to conversation history
if (finalText) {
  conversationHistory.push({
    role: "assistant",
    content: finalText,
  });
}

// Add tool results as a user message (simulating function returns)
const toolResultsText = toolResults
  .map((r: { callId: string; result: string }) => `${r.callId}: ${r.result}`)
  .join("\n\n");

conversationHistory.push({
  role: "user",
  content: `[Tool Results]:\n${toolResultsText}\n\nRespond naturally to the user.`,
});
```

## Architecture Insight

**Thread history (recent conversation) is now built into Layer 2** as a mandatory feature, not treated as an optional Layer 1 context search.

- **Layer 1**: Long-term extracted memories from past conversations (injected into system prompt)
- **Layer 2**: Current thread continuity via message history (20 most recent messages)
- **Layer 3**: Tool calling via specialized subagents

## Deployment Status

✅ Successfully deployed with `npx convex dev --once --until-success`
✅ All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
✅ Pagination types properly handled

## Testing Recommendations

1. Start a new conversation
2. Have the agent write something (e.g., "write a test email")
3. Ask the agent about what it just wrote (e.g., "send that email via Gmail")
4. The agent should now remember its previous response and have access to the email content
